# CHIP-8
CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter with C++

The code is an implementation of a CHIP-8 emulator in C++. The CHIP-8 is a simple, interpreted programming language used to create games and other programs that run on a virtual machine.

The code defines the CHIP-8 class with some constants and methods. The Chip8 constructor initializes the emulator's registers, memory, and video buffer, and loads a fontset into memory. The run method is the emulator's main loop and implements the opcode decoding and execution.

The switch statement in the run method decodes the most significant nibble of the opcode to determine which instruction to execute. Each instruction is a case in the switch statement that executes the code to carry out the instruction.

Some of the instructions included in the provided code are:

0x00E0: clear the video buffer
0x1NNN: jump to address NNN
0x2NNN: call subroutine at address NNN
0x3XNN: skip the next instruction if the value in register X is equal to NN
0x4XNN: skip the next instruction if the value in register X is not equal to NN
0x5XY0: skip the next instruction if the value in register X is equal to the value in register Y
0x6XNN: set the value of register X to NN
0x7XNN: add NN to the value in register X
0x8XY0: set the value of register X to the value in register Y
0x8XY1: set the value of register X to the bitwise OR of register X and register Y
0x8XY2: set the value of register X to the bitwise AND of register X and register Y
0x8XY3: set the value of register X to the bitwise XOR of register X and register Y
There are more instructions not listed here.
